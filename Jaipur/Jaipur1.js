            <h6 align="left"> Welcome to the Pink City of India!<br/>
              Jaipur, the capital of the North Indian State of Rajasthan, is named after its founder Maharaja Jai Singh II (1693-1743).<br/>
              The city is surrounded by hills and dotted with forts.
               Houses with pink latticed windows line the streets, and look almost magical at sunset.<br/>
              An extremely well planned city, Jaipur was designed by an engineer and scholar Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, in accordance with ancient Hindu treatise on architecture, the Shilpa Shasta (Vastu).<br/>
              The Old City, also known as the Pink City, is a wonderful place to wander around. 
              The whole city was painted pink by Maharaja Man Singh II when Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, visited Jaipur in 1876. 
              Today, every home within the city is obliged by law to maintain this facade - hence Jaipur's is also called the Pink City.</h6>
